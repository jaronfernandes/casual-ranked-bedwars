# Description

A fully functional Casual Ranked Bedwars Discord bot I made for my friends in a small Discord server. Decided to upload it to Github two and a half years later because why not?

Initially created in January 2021 using discord.js, but migrated to discord.py in December-January 2023 after severe deprecation from Discord updates.

This bot is meant for small servers as it uses a volatile file saving system that is stored on your computer.

# Setup

- Change .env.example to .env, and assign your Discord bot token to TOKEN.
- Feel free to edit *some* of the contents of files such as maps or elo-distribution.

# Requirements:
- discord, dotenv, python (preferably 3.6+)
FOR PYTHON:
- If you are a macOS user, navigate to the Applications/Python 3.11/ (or a different Python version, usually 3.6+) folder and double click on "Install Certificates.command".

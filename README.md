# casual-ranked-bedwars
A (formerly) fully functional Casual Ranked Bedwars Discord bot I made for my friends in a small Discord server. Decided to upload it to Github two and a half years later because why not?

Created (and finished) in January 2021, it has been subjected to severe deprecation due to Discord updates as it was originally built for some Discord.js version 12. My inactivity on casual ranked bedwars subsequently led to the project not being supported anymore. Due to these unforeseen updates, expect some features to not work.

This bot is meant for small servers. It takes advantage of Discord's messaging system by using a message the bot sends, and manipulates it to hold its own little database of player statistics. You will have to change this
